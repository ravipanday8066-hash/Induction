# Day 1 (30 July 2025)

The very first day of college felt less like an entry into academics and more like a soulful initiation into a community rooted in faith, values, and excellence.
Our day began in the serene and spiritual environment of the college Gurdwara Sahib. As bhajans like "Dhan Dhan Guru Anant Sahib Ji" and "Guru Ramdas Rakho Sharnayi" echoed through the space, there was a sense of collective calm. But it was "ਤੂੰ ਮਾਤ-ਪਿਤਾ ਹਮ ਬਾਲਕ ਤੇਰੇ" that truly touched my heart a hymn that gave me literal goosebumps and reminded me that I'm never alone in this journey. After the recitation of "Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh", we received Kadah prasad, filling our hearts with warmth and devotion. Post this spiritual beginning, we headed to Hostel No. 2. where we were offered refreshments. It was also our first casual walk around the gndec. The main highlight of the day was the session held in the college auditorium, where a series of insightful speeches laid the foundation of what gndec truly stands for. One of the speakers shared the history of gndec, how people of Gill Pind donated land, driven by a collective dream to create an institution that would empower future generations. It was inspiring to know that our college was built by the people, for the people. A senior professor delivered a speech that felt like a wake-up call. He emphasized how college is a sacred place - a space that deserves respect, sincerity, and discipline. Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal lit up the entire auditorium with her dynamic and motivating words. She beautifully stressed the need to:
•Stay away from negativity
•Embrace spirituality as a guiding light
•Build a mindset grounded in self-discipline and resilience
Her speech felt more like a conversation with our hearts than a formal address. Our respected Principal, Dr. Sehijpal Singh, spoke next and reinforced the idea that whatever branch we've received, we must respect it. He encouraged us to fall in love with our field, stay focused, and maintain a positive attitude- a theme that echoed throughout the day. The chief guest, a political figure and lawyer, S. Maheshinder Singh Grewal spoke from both legacy and experience. He proudly shared that his grandfather had a big role to build gndec and that one of his relatives is now an engineer at Boeing, having studied here. After the speeches, we had almost a one-hour break, a moment to breathe, meet fellow students, and reflect. It was during this time that I learned about NCC (National Cadet Corps), and instantly felt drawn to it. I silently made a wish to be a part of NCC someday and wear that uniform with pride. Post-break, we returned to the auditorium where students were divided department-wise, and group leaders were assigned. Our group was then guided through the ECE department, where we got our first glimpse of labs, classrooms. This wasn't just an orientation - it was a spiritual and intellectual awakening. From bhajans in the morning to the wisdom of experienced educators, every moment felt intentional, impactful, and deeply rooted in values. I now understand that gndec isn't just a college - it's a community of purpose, passion, and people who care. May this day remain the compass of my entire engineering journey.

# Day 2 (1 August 2025)

The second day of our induction program at GNDEC was both informative and engaging. We started the day with English and Mathematics Proficiency Tests to assess our current level of understanding in these subjects. It was a good refresher and helped us identify the areas we need to improve.
Later, the Buddy4Study team interacted with us and shared valuable information about different scholarship opportunities available for first-year students. They guided us on how to apply and which portals to use, which was really helpful for many of us.
We also had a motivational session by Dr. Arashdeep Singh, who spoke about the importance of food in a student's overall wellness. He explained how eating habits can affect not just our physical health, but also our mental clarity and energy levels. It was a refreshing reminder to be mindful of our lifestyle.
In the second half, our seniors helped us get started with GitHub. They guided us through the process of creating an account, understanding basic terminology, and shared tips on how to use it for our future projects and learning.

# Day 3 (2 August 2025)

Day 3 of the induction program at GNDEC was filled with energy, inspiration and meaningful learning.
We began the day with an exciting and interactive session by Dr. Jaswinder Singh, widely known for his "JaswinS Lab on Wheels" initiative. He made Physics and Mathematics come alive through simple yet fascinating experiments and demonstrations. His way of teaching made complex concepts feel easy and fun - it was a refreshing change from traditional classroom learning.
Next, Dr. Priya Darshni continued with a session on Universal Human Values. Her talk was thought-provoking and helped us reflect on the importance of clarity, purpose, and balance in life - not just as students but as human beings.
We were also honored to have S. Gurcharan Singh Grewal, Secretary, SGPC, as the chief guest. He addressed the students with motivating words, encouraging us to stay focused, grounded, and disciplined as we begin our academic journey.
Later, a reflective session was held where students discussed their English and Mathematics proficiency test results from Day 2. It helped us understand our current level and identify areas to improve, with guidance from our faculty.
